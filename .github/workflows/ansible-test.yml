# DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE - even though our internal CI/CD pipeline is
# Jenkins-based, we leave this file here for better visibility of sanity
# test status in the public repo.
# This file implements a Github action to run Ansible collection sanity tests
# and unit tests on the Conjur Ansible Collection. The Ansible collection tests
# are run across the following matrices:
#
# Ansible versions (Python versions):
# - stable-2.16 (3.10, 3.12)
# - stable-2.17 (3.10, 3.12)
# - stable-2.18 (3.13)
# - devel       (3.13)
#
# As Ansible's devel version is unstable, it should be considered a smoke signal
# for the next released version. Failures against the devel version should not
# be considered blocking.
