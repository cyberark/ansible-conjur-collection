# This file implements a Github action to run Ansible collection sanity tests
# and unit tests on the Conjur Ansible Collection. The Ansible collection tests
# are run across the following matrices:
#
# Ansible versions (Python versions):
# - stable-2.13 (3.8, 3.9, 3.10)
# - stable-2.14 (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
# - stable-2.15 (3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
# - devel       (3.10)
#
# As Ansible's devel version is unstable, it should be considered a smoke signal
# for the next released version. Failures against the devel version should not
# be considered blocking.
